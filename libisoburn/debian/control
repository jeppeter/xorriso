Package: libisoburn1
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: library to handle creation and inspection of ISO-9660 file systems
 libisoburn is a frontend for the libraries libburn and libisofs. It handles
 the creation, loading, manipulation and burning of ISO-9660 filesystem images.
 This library provides a low-level API, called libisoburn API, which
 encapsulates the API of libburn and libisofs, and a higher level API, called
 xorriso API which encapsulates the API of libburn, libisofs, and libisoburn,
 and is also used by the xorriso program itself.
 .
 This package contains the shared object files for libisoburn.

Description: debugging symbols for libisoburn and xorriso
 libisoburn is a frontend for the libraries libburn and libisofs. It handles
 the creation, loading, manipulation and burning of ISO-9660 filesystem images.
 This library provides a low-level API, called libisoburn API, which
 encapsulates the API of libburn and libisofs, and a higher level API, called
 xorriso API which encapsulates the API of libburn, libisofs, and libisoburn,
 and is also used by the xorriso program itself.
 .
 This package contains debugging files useful for investigating any problems
 with the binaries found in the libisoburn library and the xorriso application.

Description: command line ISO-9660 and Rock Ridge manipulation tool
 xorriso is a command line and dialog application, which creates, loads,
 manipulates, and writes ISO-9660 file system images with Rock Ridge
 extensions.
 .
 It maps file objects from POSIX compliant file systems into Rock Ridge
 enhanced ISO-9660 file systems and features session-wise manipulation
 of such file systems. It can load the management information of existing
 ISO images and write the resulting session to optical medium or as
 file system objects.
 .
 Supported optical media types: 
  - CD-R, CD-RW
  - DVD-R, DVD-R DL, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+R DL, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM
  - BD-R, BD-RE
 .
 Some interesting features:
  - Emulation of the mkisofs and cdrecord programs.
  - Data backup and restore capabilities - compression, ACLs, and filters.
  - Isohybrid MBR with partition offset - features booting ISOLINUX from
    USB sticks, or from other devices that appear to PC-BIOS as hard disks.
    The images carry a conventional partition table for a USB stick;
    the first partition reports the size of the ISO image, but starts at a
    non-zero address. It is nevertheless still mountable.
  - Jigdo Template Export - jigdo representation of the resulting ISO-9660 
    image, generated on the fly.
 .
 Test suite:
  xorriso source code comes with a release engineering test-suite called
  `releng', which aims to cover most of the functionality of the xorriso
  and the underlying libraries of libburn, libisofs, and libisoburn.
